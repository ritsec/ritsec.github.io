        caption: "The Information Security Talent Search (ISTS) is a three-day cybersecurity competition held each spring at RIT. Teams from RIT and universities nationwide face a wide range of challenges designed to span many aspects of the security industry. Competitors test their incident response skills and offensive capabilities through a CTF, King-of-the-Hill (KoTH), business report writing, and a themed gameâ€”all while defending a fully student-built infrastructure."

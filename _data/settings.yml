  <p>The Security Practices and Research Student Association (SPARSA) was founded 
  in the wake of 9/11 by RIT students Jared Campbell, Eric Linden and Matt Hile. 
  The initial faculty advisor was Dr. Samuel McQuade - Former Program Chair of 
  The Center for Multidisciplinary Studies at RIT.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Since its inception, SPARSA has been a student-run organization that addresses 
  security-related issues and how these issues affect multiple majors and disciplines. 
  The ultimate goal of this organization is to provide students with experience in 
  information security and job opportunities in information security (infosec) related 
  fields. This includes aiding members in the search for both cooperative education 
  (co-op) and full-time employment opportunities.</p>
  <br>
  <p>To meet this goal, SPARSA hosts and participates in research and development of 
  security tools and policies. In addition, SPARSA provides consulting for organizations 
  in need of improved security. SPARSA also seeks to build and maintain relationships with 
  local and national security related organizations. This includes social networking with 
  security professionals and hosting conferences, symposia, and other security-related 
  events to spur growth in this area.</p>
  <br>
  <p>As security becomes progressively more important in our increasingly global world, 
  SPARSA will help students remain on top of their game and up to date with the latest 
  security issues, practices, and research. "Today individuals, families, organizations, 
  communities and our nation face unprecedented combinations of cyber and physical security 
  threats to both cyber and physical assets. The challenge is to enhance security capabilities 
  at all levels of society by developing better security technologies, and by providing 
  education and training in the use and management of security technologies" (Dr. Samuel McQuade)</p>
